  <h1>An Example of Software That is Designed Well</h1>
  <p>An example of a piece of software which I think was personally well designed would be a stock trading software developed by 
    Interactive Brokers, it is a stock trading software which I have used to buy, sell and check on stocks. 
    I am very much pleased with their desktop interface as they have recently updated the software to make the user interface friendlier 
    and more pleasing to look at compared to the previous which preceded the current one. The interface is sleeker, and has been made more 
    simple by grouping certain functions and tasks together, which was not what the previous user interface looked like. 
    This makes it very easy for me to look at charts, and to correctly understand what kind of order I am placing and what the implications 
    of that order would be. An important update to this new user interface was the simplification of the stock market screener, 
    which is a tool that can sort stocks by certain filters. The stock screener in the last user interface was really complex to use and was 
    limited to only a few keywords and filters.</p>
  <h1>Why Software Design is Important</h1>
  <p>It is important to learn software design and to constantly revamp existing software to fit an ever-expanding market or audience. 
    In this instance, Interactive Brokers, due to a large influx of new users who may have been overwhelmed by their previous softwareâ€™s 
    user interface, had decided to revamp it and make look more modern and refreshed. This update also ensured that their software would 
    not look obsolete, compared to their competitors (such as Webull and Questrade), which is another reason as to why software design is 
    important, as new technology implemented within your software can help you have an edge over your competitors.</p>
  <h1>What is Happening in The Requirements Gathering Stage</h1>
  <p>The software requirements gathering stage is a crucial step in the software development process. In this stage, we understand what 
    we are trying to build, and how to execute said build by gathering information about a proposed plan. This information will help us in 
    getting the basic requirements of the program down. There are two requirements in a program, the functional requirements 
    (what the system should to), and the non-functional requirements (such as the manner in which the system will perform, 
    constraints, data, the environment in which the system will operate, and user characteristics). To gather this information, 
    we can interview, brainstorm, observe, ask questions (in forms of surveys) and read documentation to get a complete view on what 
    the software should accomplish. A crucial aspect of the requirements gathering stage are user stories, which is essentially a to-do 
    list for the software, what it should accomplish, and what features are offered. User stories improve communication, collaboration and d
    iscussion among every person who is involved in the development and distribution of the software, ensuring that there is no 
    miscommunication between the people involved, and that users of the software gets their needs fulfilled.</p>
  <h1>Developing The Software I Personally Think is Designed Well</h1>
  <p>If I was assigned to develop a software that I think is well designed, which would be the desktop stock trading software created 
    by Interactive Brokers, these would be the user stories that would create the foundations of the trading software:<br><br>

    - As a non-professional trader, I want to view real-time stock market data, so that I can make precise decisions on when to buy and sell stocks.<br>
    - As an options trader, I want to access options chains and place complex orders so that I can implement my advanced trading strategies, 
    and leverage my money efficiently.<br>
    - As a retired person, I want to easily monitor my investment portfolio, so that I can ensure my investments provide stable passive returns.<br>
    - As a young investor, I want a simple and intuitive interface for buying and selling stocks, so that I can start growing my money without 
    feeling overwhelmed with complex tools.<br>
    - As a cautious investor, I want tools that provide portfolio scores and personalized investment recommendations, so that I can assess if my 
    investment decisions are good and make adjustments to improve my returns.<p>
