  <h1>An Example of Software That is Designed Well</h1>
  <p>
    An example of a piece of software which I think was personally well designed would be a stock trading software 
    developed by Interactive Brokers. It is a stock trading software which I have used to buy, sell, and check on stocks. 
    I am very much pleased with their desktop interface as they have recently updated the software to make the user interface friendlier 
    and more pleasing to look at compared to the previous one. The interface is sleeker and has been made more simple by grouping 
    certain functions and tasks together, which was not what the previous user interface looked like. 
    This makes it very easy for me to look at charts and to correctly understand what kind of order I am placing and what the implications 
    of that order would be. An important update to this new user interface was the simplification of the stock market screener, 
    which is a tool that can sort stocks by certain filters. The stock screener in the last user interface was really complex to use 
    and was limited to only a few keywords and filters.

  <h1>Why Software Design is Important</h1>
  <p>
    It is important to learn software design and to constantly revamp existing software to fit an ever-expanding market or audience. 
    In this instance, Interactive Brokers, due to a large influx of new users who may have been overwhelmed by their previous software’s 
    user interface, decided to revamp it and make it look more modern and refreshed. 
    This update also ensured that their software would not look obsolete compared to their competitors (such as Webull and Questrade), 
    which is another reason why software design is important. New technology implemented within your software can help you have 
    an edge over your competitors.

  <h1>What is Happening in The Requirements Gathering Stage</h1>
  <p>
    The software requirements gathering stage is a crucial step in the software development process. 
    In this stage, we understand what we are trying to build and how to execute said build by gathering information about a proposed plan. 
    This information will help us in getting the basic requirements of the program down. 
    There are two types of requirements in a program: functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements 
    (such as the manner in which the system will perform, constraints, data, the environment in which the system will operate, 
    and user characteristics). To gather this information, we can interview, brainstorm, observe, ask questions (in forms of surveys), 
    and read documentation to get a complete view of what the software should accomplish. 
    A crucial aspect of the requirements gathering stage is user stories, which are essentially a to-do list for the software, 
    detailing what it should accomplish and what features are offered. 
    User stories improve communication, collaboration, and discussion among everyone involved in the development and distribution 
    of the software, ensuring there is no miscommunication and that users of the software get their needs fulfilled.

  <h1>Developing The Software I Personally Think is Designed Well</h1>
  <p>
    If I was assigned to develop software that I think is well designed, which would be the desktop stock trading software 
    created by Interactive Brokers, these would be the user stories that would create the foundations of the trading software:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>As a non-professional trader, I want to view real-time stock market data, so that I can make precise decisions on when to buy and sell stocks.</li>
    <li>As an options trader, I want to access options chains and place complex orders so that I can implement my advanced trading strategies and leverage my money efficiently.</li>
    <li>As a retired person, I want to easily monitor my investment portfolio, so that I can ensure my investments provide stable passive returns.</li>
    <li>As a young investor, I want a simple and intuitive interface for buying and selling stocks, so that I can start growing my money without feeling overwhelmed with complex tools.</li>
    <li>As a cautious investor, I want tools that provide portfolio scores and personalized investment recommendations, so that I can assess if my investment decisions are good and make adjustments to improve my returns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Persona: A Typical User of Interactive Brokers</h1>
  <p>
    The software discussed in previous writing assignments was the desktop stock trading software created by Interactive Brokers, 
    which is used by a variety of people, from individuals who do not have much experience with investing to individuals who have a career in investment.

  <h1>Significance of Effective Communication</h1>
  <p>
    In software design, effective communication is important as it ensures successful project development. 
    It enables team members, such as developers, designers, and stakeholders, to align on project goals, 
    understand requirements, and address challenges together. By encouraging clear and organized communication, 
    teams can minimize errors and ensure a smooth workflow of the task at hand. 
    Three key elements of effective communication are: clarity, constructive feedback, and adaptability. 
    Clarity helps to simplify complex ideas, reducing misunderstanding among teams. 
    Constructive feedback provides opportunities for improvement and keeps the project aligned with expectations. 
    Transparency builds trust and ensures that everyone stays informed about progress and potential roadblocks, 
    and adaptability allows teams to adjust communication methods as needed, making interactions more effective 
    under changing circumstances.
  </p>

  <h1>A Communication Issue I Have Encountered</h1>
  <p>
    A communication issue that I faced was the difficulty using CourseLink (D2L platform), where frequent technical problems 
    disrupted my ability to submit assignments, take quizzes, and view grades. These site issues, paired with the reliance that schools 
    have on this site, have created confusion and stress, particularly around meeting deadlines. 
    Looking back, I realize that I could have approached the problem differently, by doing the right thing, and informing instructors 
    and sharing detailed documentation of the problems that I faced. 
    Through what I have learned in class, I now see the value in seeking support and maintaining clear communication. 
    Collaborating with classmates who were also affected could have strengthened my case when reaching out for help, 
    potentially leading to quicker resolutions and alternative arrangements. 
    What I have learned in class emphasizes the importance of seeking support and maintaining open communication, 
    which could have reduced the burden.

  <h1>Hick's Law: Definition and Importance</h1>
  <p>
    Hick’s Law is a usability principle that states the time it takes for a user to make a decision increases with the number of available options. 
    Simplifying and reducing choices allows users to navigate a system more efficiently and with less cognitive strain. In the context of software design, 
    Hick’s Law is crucial for creating user-friendly interfaces by presenting only relevant and necessary options. As a result, this reduces the likelihood 
    of user frustration and errors, especially for complex systems like educational tools or financial software. This principle ensures that users can focus 
    on completing their tasks without being distracted or overwhelmed by unnecessary features, improving the overall usability and effectiveness of the software.
  </p>

  <h1>Hick's Law: Examples in Action</h1>
  <p>
    An excellent example of Hick’s Law in action is the revamped desktop app for the Interactive Brokers (IBKR) trading software. Previously, 
    the software had a clunky and non-modular design, making it hard to use compared to competitors like Webull and Questrade. After a significant 
    overhaul and revamp of the application, the new interface grouped related features, simplified navigation, and introduced a modern, visually appealing layout.
    The redesign grouped related functionalities, making it easier for users to navigate and focus on their trading activities. Features like the stock screener 
    and portfolio tracker, which were once cumbersome, became intuitive and visually appealing, and hence, many users praised the redesign, noting that the new 
    interface was not only on par with competitors but even exceeded them in many areas, offering advanced tools while remaining accessible. This redesign 
    demonstrates how simplifying choices and creating a clean, modular interface can reduce decision fatigue, improve user satisfaction, and elevate the software to 
    industry-leading standards.
