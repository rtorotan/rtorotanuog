  <h1>An Example of Software That is Designed Well</h1>
  <p>An example of a piece of software which I think was personally well designed would be a stock trading software developed by 
    Interactive Brokers, it is a stock trading software which I have used to buy, sell and check on stocks. 
    I am very much pleased with their desktop interface as they have recently updated the software to make the user interface friendlier 
    and more pleasing to look at compared to the previous which preceded the current one. The interface is sleeker, and has been made more 
    simple by grouping certain functions and tasks together, which was not what the previous user interface looked like. 
    This makes it very easy for me to look at charts, and to correctly understand what kind of order I am placing and what the implications 
    of that order would be. An important update to this new user interface was the simplification of the stock market screener, 
    which is a tool that can sort stocks by certain filters. The stock screener in the last user interface was really complex to use and was 
    limited to only a few keywords and filters.</p>
  <h1>Why Software Design is Important</h1>
  <p>It is important to learn software design and to constantly revamp existing software to fit an ever-expanding market or audience. 
    In this instance, Interactive Brokers, due to a large influx of new users who may have been overwhelmed by their previous softwareâ€™s 
    user interface, had decided to revamp it and make look more modern and refreshed. This update also ensured that their software would 
    not look obsolete, compared to their competitors (such as Webull and Questrade), which is another reason as to why software design is 
    important, as new technology implemented within your software can help you have an edge over your competitors.</p>
